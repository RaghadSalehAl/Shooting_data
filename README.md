## Summary of Findings

> on this project I invistegate a dataset called 'Mother Jones - Mass Shootings Database, 1982 – 2022' and based on the result above we consider gender, race, and year as an important element so, the number of crimes are increased every few years and the highest number of crimes was between 2015 – 2019 also 2022 considered as a large number. Because it’s easier to hold a gun or any kind of weapon with time considering the developing of technology and that make us think about the future and how must’ve been easy to carry a weapon. Also, the gender is very important element if you see the pivot and the tabular you will know that men murdered a lot comparing to women.
